        <title>A method to identify areas of brain dysconnectivity</title>
        <description>Resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) has become a popular tool to study brain disorders. There has been accumulating evidence showing association of various brain disorders, such as schizophrenia and autism, with brain dysconnectivity and, in general, with alterations in brain networks.  In this post, I would like to describe a common method used to identify areas of dysconnectivity in the brain, namely the global brain connectivity analysis.</description>

        <title>Working with the Allen Mouse Brain Reference Atlas</title>
        <description>The Allen Brain Atlas portal is an entry point to a wealth of publicly available information on the structure, function, and development of the nervous system. In the following series of posts, I would like to introduce several of those resources and show how to work with them.</description>
