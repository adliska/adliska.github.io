Our mission at Glyphic is to make finding, creating, and sharing enterprise information as easy as possible. And -- we are [hiring](https://glyphic-ai.rocket.hr/)!

Previously, I was a research engineer at DeepMind, focusing on machine learning
and natural language processing, and at Spotify, where I built machine

Lab](https://www.iit.it/research/lines/functional-neuroimaging)
(Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia), working with
[Alessandro Gozzi](https://www.iit.it/people/alessandro-gozzi).
I did my BSc in Computer Science at Charles University in Prague working on
machine translation with [Ond≈ôej Bojar](http://www1.cuni.cz/~obo/),
and my MSc in Computer and Cognitive Sciences at
The University of Melbourne and University of Trento
working on computer vision, distributional semantics and
