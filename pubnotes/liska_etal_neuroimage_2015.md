Network measures such as connection strength, diversity and modularity 
were calculated using the [Brain Connectivity 
Toolbox](https://sites.google.com/site/bctnet/), specifically,
using *strengths_und_sign*, *diversity_coef_sign* and 
*modularity_louvain_und_sign* functions. 

Module stability maps and other calculations were perfomed with
*ad hoc* Bash/Python scripts which I'm happy to provide upon request.

Visualisation was mostly performed in [Mango](http://ric.uthscsa.edu/mango/)
and Matlab.
